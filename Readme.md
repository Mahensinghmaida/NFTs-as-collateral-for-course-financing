# NFTs as Collateral for Course Financing

## Project Description
This project enables students to use NFTs as collateral to secure financing for educational courses. By locking their NFT assets, borrowers can access loans to fund their education and repay over a predetermined period. If the borrower fails to repay, the NFT can be liquidated to recover the funds.
